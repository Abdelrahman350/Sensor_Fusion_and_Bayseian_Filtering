function [mu, sigma2] = posteriorGaussian(mu_x, sigma2_x, y, sigma2_r)
%posteriorGaussian performs a single scalar measurement update with a
%measurement model which is simply "y = x + noise".
%
%Input
%   MU_P            The mean of the (Gaussian) prior density.
%   SIGMA2_P        The variance of the (Gaussian) prior density.
%   SIGMA2_R        The variance of the measurement noise.
%   Y               The given measurement.
%
%Output
%   MU              The mean of the (Gaussian) posterior distribution
%   SIGMA2          The variance of the (Gaussian) posterior distribution

%Your code here
mu = (sigma2_x .* y + sigma2_r .* mu_x) ./ (sigma2_x + sigma2_r);
sigma2 = (sigma2_x .* sigma2_r) ./ (sigma2_x + sigma2_r);
